# Alternative-Way-of-performing-BBS

The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to validate and compare their predictions against a professionalâ€™s assessment of a health patient using the Berg Balance Scale. This study is to determine whether using subset features from the BBS as training data for ML models can be a standalone method of predicting patient fall risk.

## Project Items

## Code Example

The execution of SVM for one subset.

```py
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=rs)

# NO PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT
model = SVC()
model.fit(X_train,y_train)
y_predict = model.predict(X_test)

# WITH PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT
param_grid = {'C': [0.1,1, 10, 100, 1000], 'gamma': [1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001]}
grid = GridSearchCV(SVC(),param_grid,refit=True,verbose=0)
grid.fit(X_train,y_train)
grid_predict = grid.predict(X_test)
```
