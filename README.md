# Alternative-Way-of-performing-BBS

The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to validate and compare their predictions against a professionalâ€™s assessment of a health patient using the Berg Balance Scale. This study is to determine whether using subset features from the BBS as training data for ML models can be a standalone method of predicting patient fall risk.
